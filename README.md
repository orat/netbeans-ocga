# netbeans-ocga

## Description
Conformal geometric algebra filetype - integration into the netbeans ide

This is a plugin for the Netbeans-IDE which includes a ".ocga"-file type for including geometric algebra code in the specific [DSL](https://github.com/MobMonRob/DSL4GeometricAlgebra).

For this file-type Syntax-Highlighting based on [Textmate](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars) is added and it includes configurations which allows to debug into these files. Further tooling support is planed and partially implemented e.g. GraalVM lanugage server.

## Execution
To use it, simply reload it into the running IDE.

## Disclaimer
The project is in an early state of development but Syntaxhighlighting works fine.
