This is a plugin for the Netbeans-IDE which includes a ".ocga"-file type for including geometric algebra code in the specific [DSL](https://github.com/MobMonRob/DSL4GeometricAlgebra).

For this file-type Syntax-Highlighting based on [Textmate](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars) is added. Further tooling support is planed.
